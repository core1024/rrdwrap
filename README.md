Wraper functions for librrd in C

This functions are written by Antony Clothier and slightly edited by me, to fit my needs.

My changes:
 * The rrd_graph function wasn't working so i had to change it a bit.
 * The argument parser now can handle single quotes. Also the quotes are striped from the argument.
